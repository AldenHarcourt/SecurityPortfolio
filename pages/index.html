      <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I love the sport of Ultimate Frisbee. I've played since 4th grade and don't plan to stop anytime soon. I play for the best team out there, Carleton CUT. CUTRULEZ.</li>
        <li>I've been learning photography over the past few years. Another skill which I plan to improve throughout my whole life. (Some of my best photographs coming to this page soon)</li>
        <li>It would feel wrong not to include cybsersecurity as a personal interest. I specifically have enjoyed learning about personal information security lately as well as learning about pen-testing.</li>
